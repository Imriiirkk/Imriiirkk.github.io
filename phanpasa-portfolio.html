            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Phanpasa Khunsri, and my nickname is Film. I'm currently a third-year student majoring
                in Digital Media Engineering at Khon Kaen University.
                I'm passionate about software development and computer network, especially building applications and
                solving real-world problems.
                I believe my skills in coding and problem-solving can contribute to creating innovative tools and
                impactful solutions.

                <h3>Project Reflection: Lessons Beyond Coding</h3>
                <p>
                    <time daetime="2025-07-9">July 9, 2025</time>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Working on projects throughout my studies has taught me much more than just programming skills.
                    While coding is important, collaborating with teammates, managing time effectively,
                    and communicating clearly are equally essential to achieve project goals.
                    I learned that a well-organized plan and clear division of tasks help the team stay focused and
                    productive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest lessons I gained was the value of teamwork. Sharing ideas openly and listening to
                    different perspectives led to better solutions and a stronger sense of commitment.
                    These experiences have not only improved my technical abilities but also prepared me for real-world
                    working environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These project experiences have shaped me not only as a coder but also as a professional ready to
                    work in real-world settings. I believe these soft skills are just as important as technical
                    knowledge for future success.
